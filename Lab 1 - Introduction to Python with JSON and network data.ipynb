    "This notebook guides you through process of loading and analyzing real (but anonymized) Facebook data. The two goals for the notebook are to give you a better idea of the workflow for doing data analysis with Python and to introduce you to a \"big data\" type data source. In particular, we'll focus on networks because they go hand-in-hand with the big data movement. We aren't using your own live Facebook data because the Facebook API (system for accessing their databases) much more aggressively limits what data we can get. Yay for privacy! Too bad for us big data nerds:(\n",

    "### Topic 1: the JSON format \n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to get data from webpages is through an application programming interface, commonly called an API. Some sites maintain APIs for users who need to send/receive lots of data to/from the site's servers or need to do it algorithmically. When a financial site is displaying stock prices, it is algorithmically updating from something like Bloomberg's or NASDAQ's quote APIs. Alternatively, major record labels will use an API to upload songs or download information about plays from Spotify. In most cases you need to apply and pay for special permissions to use APIs. The most common exception is Twitter and that is an important reason it has been so popular in social science research.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common format for API data is the *JSON* (JavaScript Object Notation) format. A *JSON* formatted file is human-readable and ends with *.json*. At this point, the format's only meaningful connection to its namesake JavaScript is that it is built around the concept of *objects*, which is at the core of the object-oriented programming paradigm that Java helped popularized. This matters to us only in that thinking in terms of objects is helpful for a lot of big data research.\n",
